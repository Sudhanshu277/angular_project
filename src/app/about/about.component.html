						<p style="padding: 20px;text-align: center;" class="text-justify">Academia and Industry are two different worlds which operate on different pedestals. Both have different purposes and different ideologies. Being so different from each other, these two worlds are still somehow interconnected. The aspiring graduates dreams to land on his desired career right after accomplishing their Higher Education.<strong><span style="font-family: 'Vesper Libre', serif;font-size: 20px;"> As per the recent statistics, Indiaâ€™s economy is expected to grow at a fast pace;
						rapid industrialization would require  a gross incremental workforce of ~250 million by 2030.</span></strong><br>
						<br>
						However, despite such encouraging stats there is a large gap between the industry and the academia, which hinders the efficient transmission of a student from the education sector to corporate sector. The major reason of this gap is the issues and problems which persist in the Indian Education System. Due to these the academia is not able to cater to the current industrial demands.</p>
